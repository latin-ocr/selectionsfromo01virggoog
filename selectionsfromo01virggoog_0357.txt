The subject 01 the First Book 10 the tillage 01 the ground witha
view to crops, chiefly corn. The mention 01 the uncertainty 01 the

’ weather at different times 01 the year leads the poet to give a list 01

the signs 01 0 010110 and 01 1011 10011101, which he abridges from the
Diosemezo 01 Aratus. From this he passes to the signs 01 the polit-
ical storm which had broken over Rome, and shows that externat
nature had been no less eloquent there, while he prays that Octavi·
anus Caesar may yet be spared to save society.
