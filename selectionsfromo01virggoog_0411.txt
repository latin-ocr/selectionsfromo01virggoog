ARGUMENT.

Ama stating the subject of the poem generally ( 1 - 7), addressing
the Muse (8-11), and accounting for the resentment of Juno to the
Trojan race (12- 33), the poet introduces his hero, Aeneas, the son
,οἱ Anchises and Venus, in the seventh year of his wanderings after
the destruction of Troy, when he had just started from Sicily, and
was making for the Italian mainlandr a tempest is sent forth against
him by Aeolus, at the instigation of Juno, which sinks one of the
ships and drives the rest in a sbattered condition on the coast of
Africa (34-123). Neptune interferes to calm the storm (124- 156).
' Aeneas lands with seven out of twenty ships, slays seven stags of im·
mense size, gives one carcass to each of the ships, and exhorts his
companions to patience and hope (157-207). The banquet of the
ships’ crews is described (208-222). Venus pleads the cause of her

¹ son Aeneas and of the Trojans before Jupiter, and lays all the blame

of their misfortunes on Juno (223-253). The king of the gods, v
moved by the appeal, discloses the decrees of the Fates, and consoles
his daughter by the assurance of future prosperity and unbounded
empire to the Trojans in their descendente, the Roman people (254
-296). Mercury is sent down to render Dido, queen of Carthage,
friendly to Aeneas (297- 304). Satisfied with the declaration of Jupi-
ter, Venus descends to earth, and in the guise of a huntress presents
herself to Aeneas, and announccs that the ships which he had sup·
posed lost were safe in port (305--409.) Aeneas proceeds to Car·

. thage, accompanicd by Achates, both rendered invisible by the care

of- Venus (410-420). Carthage is described in progress of building
(421-436). Aeneas visits the temple of Juno, and sees depicted there
the Trojan wars (437-493). Dido visits the temple (494- 508). A
deputation from the twelve missing ships of the Trojbns waits 00 Dido .
to complain of the outragcs of her peopleand bewail the loss ol Ae·
neas (509 - 560). Dido consoles them, and offers them a settlement ,
(561-578). Aeneas, freed from the cloud, appears, and addresses
Dido, who replies ltindly, and prepares to entertain him and his fol·
lowers (579-642). Aeneas sends for Ascanius (643-656). Venus
substitutes Cupid for Ascanius (657 -698). The banquet is given in
Dido’s palace (699- 747). Dido asks Aeneas to narrate the downfall
of Troy and his own wanderings (748- 756).
