TliE AENEID. Boon V.

IN the first hall of the Aeneid it would almost seem as it Vugil had
intentionally relieved those portions ol his narrative which possess ’
the most absorbing interest with others of a more level and less
exciting kind The detailed aoconnt ol the agonies ol the one night
ol Troy’s capture was succeeded bya rapid sketch os the events of
seven years ol travel ; and now we pass from the spectacle ol Dido's
frantie love and (as a modern reader will regard it) Aeneas's faidu-
lessness to a description of the gnmes celebrated by the Trojan hero
in Sicily on the anniversary ol his lather's death This serves to
conduct us from the tragedy ol the Fourth'Book to the mysterious
solemnities ol the Sixth Aeneas does not pass at once from the
terrible conflict ol love aud duty to the initiation which is reserved
lor the chosen lavorites ol Heaven, but is shown to us as the pious
and beneficent prince, reverentially dutifnl to his lather's memory,
and kind and liberal to his followers and friends, -encouraging the
ambition of his own rnen and returning the courtesies os the Sicilians
by a display in which itis his honor to be the dispenser os honors to
others

ARGUMENT.

Anum, leaving Carthage, sets sail for Italy, but by the violence of
atempest isasecond time driven on the coast ol Sicily, where, as-
sisted by Acestes, he celebrates games at the tomb ol his father Au·
chises, on the anniversary ol his death (1-603). In the meantime
the Trojan women, instigated by Iris, the messenger of Juno, set lire
to the ships, ol which four are burned, the others being miracu·
lously preserved hy Jupiter (604-699). - Anchises appears to Aeneas
in a vision on the following night, and gives him advice aud direction
with regard to his luture course (700- 746). Aeneas lounds the town
of Acesta and leaves, as colonists, many ol the matrons, and the old
meu unfit lor active service in war, and himself again puts to sea with
his fleet lor Latium (741-778). In this voyage Neptune renders the
sea propitious, and, at length, alter his many wanderings, Aeneas
reaches Italy, having, however, lost his pilot Palinurus when near
the Hesperien coast (779- 871).
