Arnus having lauded at Cumae, immediately seeirs the cave of

' the Sibyl, and consults the oracle: from it he learns some particulare

of his dangers and further labors {r - 155). He performs funeral rites
to the body of Misenus, and while engaged iu the preparatione for
this ceremony, discovers the golden bough, which, as a gift to Proser-
pina, would gain for him permissioa to pass to the Elysian shades, to
meet and converse with his father Anchises. Provided with it and
accompanied by the Sibyl, he reaches the entrance to the infernal
regions ( 1 56- 336). On the hither side of the Styx he meets with the
shade of his quondam pilot Palinurus, and after receiving from him 3
detailed account of the circumstances attending his death, he promises
to perform to him the due obsequias on his return to earth, and to
erect a cenotaph (337- 383). Crossing the Styx, he traversos the dis·
trict occupied by the spirits of infants, and of those who had been
unjustly put to death, and enters that where wander in solitude ill-
requited lovers, -their own murderers In this latter place he falls
in with Dido, who, however, indignantly declines a conversation (384-
476). In the region of slain warriors, Deiphobus, among others, pre·
sents himself, all mangled as be was (477- 534). , Η3 passes Tartarus
on the right, and is instructed by the Sibyl in all the varieties of puu-
ishment, which were inflicted on the grossly wicked in the abode set
apart for them (535-627). He next reaches the palace of Dis, aud,
having fixed the golden bough ou theentrance, directs his course to
the habitations of ' the blessed, and, under the guidance of Musaeus,
at length finds Anchises (628-678). Having fully discoursed on the
nature of the soal, its purification, and the processes necessary to
bring about final perfection, Anchises lays briefly before Aeneas the
history of the Roman empne, which his posterity are to found (679-
888). On the conclusion of the interview our hero audiris guide
ascend to earth again through the ivory gate, the Sibyl departing
to her cave, and Aeneas to his lieet, which he moors at Caieta.
