ECLOGUE VII. - MELIBOEUS.

Tffls is another singing·match between Corydon and Thyrsis, with
Daphnis as umpire. Unlilte those in Eclogues ΙΙΙ. and V.‚ it ends
decisively in the defeat of Thyrsis The story is told by Meliboeus,
who was not present until ‚the terma of the contest had been agreed
on, so that of them we hear nothing. '

The scenery is, as usual, confused. Arcadian shepherds are made
to sing in the neighborhood of the Mincius, while neither the ilex (v.
1), the pine (v. 24), the chestnut (v. 53), nor the floclrs of goats (v. 7),
would seem to belong to Mantua.

After an introduction of twenty verses, the style is amoebean (see
Introduction to Eclogue ΙΙΙ.), the rivals singing four verSes' each and
constantly changing the subject.
