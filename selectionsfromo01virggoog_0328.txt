THE BUCOLICS.

THE ten short poema called Bucolica were the earliest works of
Virgil, and probably all written between B. C. 41, and B. C. 37.
They are not Bucolica in the same sense as the poems of Theocritus,
which have the same title. They have att a Bucolic form and color·

The publication of the Bucolico created a great sensation in literary
Rome. Honors were publicly lavished on the author. They were
recite'd on the stage ; and it is said that, on one occasion, when the
poet happen‘ed to be present, all the spectators rose and paid him
the same marks of respect which they would have shown to Au
