wild, rocky Aeolia, where the winds had their home, where the cave
of the winds was. -140. Veneram referring to the whole company,
vthough only one is named. ma . . . in aula. Illa plainly refers
aula to immam'a saxa and vernas domos ; therefore the aula (or court),
in which Aeolus is here told to display his power ( se jactet), is neither
the celsa arx of v. 56, nor “the cavern of the winds,'' but simply the
country of Aeolia. -141, Clamo -. earcere. Gr. 431. A. dr S.
257: Clausois emphatic. Let him close the prison of the winde, and
then let him reign absolute. This is Henry's interpretation, and just
the opposite of the common one, viz. let him reign absolute in the
closed prison of the winds; but it is preferred for three reasons ε ist,
the command thus interpreted is compatible with the dignlty of Nep·
tune3 ad, imperatively required by the circumstances of the case;

might be as despotie as he pleased among the immania saxa of Aeo·

-148-156. This simile is remarkable as an illustration of Nature ,
from man, the reverse of which is the general rule in Virg. as in Ho-
mer. The image was no doubt suggested by the riots in the Roman
forum during the political contests of the later republic. Itis an in·
stance ofa simile where the construction of the sentence is fully
drawn out. Ac couples the whole with what has gone before. The
apodosis to veluti is sic (v. 154) ; that to quum would seem to be tum
