cantas on which the younger artist might work, bnt the tale of Troy
taken forms no part of the narrative of the Odyssey; tt is briefly sung
bya bard, whose shains move the teara of Ulyssas, as the Trojan
portraits of Carthage have moved mosa of Aeneas3 but that is all.
It was open to Virgit to make his hero tell the whole story of the de-
struction of Troy without trespassing on Homer's gronnd; and he
seiced the opportunity. The subject could not fail to be most im·
pressive, and it is introduced with perfect propriety. Dido, it is true,
knew the main incidente of the siege; bnt for that very reason she
would wislr to hear them eom the chief living witness on the side of
Troy. Virgil, too, has shown ltis wisdom not only in what he has said,
but in what he has left unsaid Dido’s curiosity would naturally ex·
tend over the whole ten years3 ,bnt the poet knew that a detail of the
siege, natural as it might be, would weary his readers. He tells us
that the queen askcd of Priam and Hector, of Diomedes andAchilles;
but he does not require us to listen to Aeneas till he can concentrate
our attention on “the last agony of Troy,” the one night in which
the city was taken and sacked.

’ Arsuras, in compliance with Dido’s aequest, details the particulare

of the capture of Troy, so far as he had witnessed them. After ex·
pressing reluctance to right his ‹lisagreeable battles over again, the
hero goes on to tell of the despondency of the Greeks in the tenth
year of the war, together with their stratagem of the horse. Lurlting
in Tenedos, they send a cunning fellow, Sinon, to prepare the way
for the reception of the wooden horse, which they pretended to be a
return for the stolen Palladium. The Trojans are credulous, and
believe the whole, but Laocoon sees through the deceit, and exposes
it His wamings, however, are vain ς and he is himself slain by two
serpents sent against him by Minerva (1449). The Greeks return
from Tenedos, the horse is opened‚ and the city is taken (250-267).
Aeneas is warned by Hector's shade to consult for his safety, but he
is too valiant to follow the suggestion before he has tried what might
can do. He makes an attempt, and is for awltile successful, till, hav·
ing assumed the annor of some Greeks, whom they had elain, his
associates are mistaken by the Trojans, and many of them killed by
their own friends' (268-437). Then follows the sack of Priam's
palace, and the murder of the king¹ himself (438- 558). Aeneas, on
his way homeward to save his father, is presented from slaying Helen
by a vision (559-631). Anchises refuses to seek safety, bnt at last,
encouraged by heavenly signs, consents (632 - 704). The flight (705-¹
