ol its arms and the extent ol its conquasm' lt would be absurd to
suppose that Virgil’s verses induced any‘Rornan to put his band to
the plough, or to take from bis bailili the management of hia own
estates3 but they served undoubtedly to revive some ol the simple
tastes and sentimenta of the olden time, and to perpetuate, amidst the
vices and corruptions of the empire, a pure stream of sober and inno·

The epic poem of Virgil, the Aeneid, was probably long contem-

to have had a strong desire of composing an epic poem, and, like him
also, to have been long undecided on his subject. He is said to have
begun a metrical chronicle ol the Alban Kings‚ but atterwards to
have given it up because oi the harshness os the names. Alter the
completlon of the Georgica or perhaps somewhat earlier, he laid
down the plan ol a regular epic on the wanderings oi Aeneas, and
