THE STORY OF ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE.-Orpheus 1
was the son os Oeagrus, king os Thrace, and the Muse Calliope.

' Presented with the lyre by Apollo, and instructed by the Muses in its

use, he enchanted with its music not only the wild beasts, but the ·
very trees and rocks, which moved from their places to follow the

aid, which contributed materially to the success of their expedition.
He married the nymph Eurydice, the legend of whose loss and re-
coveryishere given. .
