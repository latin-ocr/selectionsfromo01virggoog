THE GEORGICS. Book 11.

'litu main subject oi the Second Book is the culture of trees,
especially the vine. But there is no great regularity in the mode
oi treatment. Virgil opens with an enumeration ot' the different ways
ol propagating trees, natural and artificial, so as to give some notion
ol the magnitude ol the theme ; then shows how art can improve
upon nature, aud recurs again to the maniloldness os his subject,
dwelling especially on the innumerable varieties of vines. Without
much relevancy he talks ol the trees which are indigenous to different
countries, and thence digresses into a eulogy os Italy, which he does
not fit with any practical application. The question of the aptitudes ·
os vadous soils is treated far more widely than the subject of the
book requires, embracing the choice of corn and pasture land, as
well as ol ground lor planting vines and other trees For the next
160 lines the poet seems to be thinking exclusively of the vine, or of
the trees planted in the arbertum as its supporters. He does not
distinguish between the different modes os nearing the vine, but in
general appears to assume that the arbustum will be the means
adopted He speaks oi the vine and its supporters almost indiffer-
ently, as objects more or less of the same culture, so that, while
keeping the former prominently before him, he feels himself at liberty
to nse general language, or even to confine his language to the latter,
as metrical convenience or poetical variety may suggest; amanner

' ol speaking which renders this part of the book peculiarly difficolt

The olive, which was put prominently forward in the programme os
the book, is actually disposed ofin a very lew lines, as requiring
hardly any culture at all, while the other fruit-trees are dismissed
even more briefly. The remaining trees receive a very hasty recom-
mendation to the cultivator, backed however with an assurance that
they are even more useful to man than the vine. In the celebrated
digression which concludes the book, the laborious aspectos a
country lise, elsewhere so prominent, is studiously kept out os sight,
and we hear only of ease, enjoyment, and plenty.

The &autiss os this book have always been admired, and deserv-

edly so. They are most conspicuous in the digressions; but the
more strictly didactic part contains innumerable felicities ol expres· Ι
sion, though it may be doubted whether in general they do not ob-
scure the practical meaning as much as they illustrate it.
