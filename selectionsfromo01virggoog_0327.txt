THE LIFE Ol* VIRGlL. 431

road (Via Puteolana) from Naples to Puteoli (Pozzuoli)‚ between the
fust and second milestones from Naples The monument now called
the tomb of Virgil is not on the road which passes through the tun·
nel of Posilippo; butif the Via Puteolana ascended the hill of Posilip· .
po, as it may have done, the situation of the monument would agree
verywell with the description of Donatus

The following inscription is said to have been placed on the tomb:

Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc ’
Parthenope. Cechi pascua, rura, duces

From internal evidence rt is improbable that it was written by the
poet, though Donatus says that rt was

Virgil named as heredes in his testament his half· brother, Valerius
Proculus, to whom he left one half of his estate, and also Augustus,
Maecenas, 1. Varius, and Plotius Tucca. The poet had been en-
riched by the liberality of his patrous, and he left behind him a con·
siderable property, and a house on the Esquiline Hill near the gar·
dens of Maecenas. He used his wealth liberally‚ and his library,
which was doubtless a good one, was easy of access. He used to
send¹ his parents money every year. His father, who became blind,
did not die before his son had attained amature age. Two brothers
of Virgil also died before him. Poetry was not the only stndy of
Virgil: he applied himself to medicine aud to agriculture, as the
Georgica show; and also to what Donatus calls Marmarica, per·
haps a jumble of ,astrology and astronomy. His stature was tall, his
complexion dark, and his appearance that of a rustic He was mod-
est and retiring‚ and his character is free from reproach‚ ifwe ex·
cept one scandalous passage iu Donatus, which may not tell the truth.

In his fortunes and his friends Virgil was a happy man Munificent
patronage gave him ample means of enjoyment and of leisure, and he
had the friendship of all the most accomplished men of the day,
among whom Ho'race entertained a strong affection for him. He was

an amiable good-tempered man, free from the mean passione of envy .

andjealousy ; and in all but health he was prosperous. His fame,
which was established in his lisetime, was cherished aster his death
as an inheritance in which every Roman had a share No writer
probably ever exercised so wide an influence either in time or space.
His works became school-books even before the death of Augustus,
and have continued such ever since; they were even translated into
Greek; they were commented on by a host of grammarians; they
were the subject of innumerable epigrams; they were formed into cen·
tos ς they were used for the purposes of divination. They have taken
their place among the imperishable offspn'ng of genius, and, while
literature lasis, will continue to exercise a powerful intirience on the
poetical taste uf successive generations.
