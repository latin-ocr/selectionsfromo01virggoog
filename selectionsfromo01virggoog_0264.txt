The works of Ovid up to the time of his exile have already been
enumerated. To these are to be added the five books of elegies
called Trono, written during the first four years of his banishment,
and the four books of ¹Epistoloe cx Ponto, written subsequently, in the
same measure as the Tristia, and, like' that work, made up of descrip-
tions of his afflicted condition and petitions for mercy. There is also
asatirical poem called Ibis, written in exile, and several other pieces,
whose genuineness is more or less doubtful. Of the twelve books of
the Fasti, only six have come down to us, and some have thought
that only six were ever written. The Metamorphoses, which the poet
bumt on going into exile, was complete in its plan, though it had not
received its last touches, and copies of it were already in the hands
of friends, through whom it was preserved

“ lf Ovid, as a man, was unfortunate, as a poet he cannot be alto·
. gether so regarded He was born at the happiest time for the'exhi·
bition of his chief excellence, skill in the mechanical structure of his
language. Even in the Julian Age he would scarcely have developed
this, nor, if he had, would it have been duly appreciated; and imme-
diately after his decease a new school had arisen. Of the mutual
adaptation of his time and his genius he was fully sensible; and he
made good use of his opportunities. When we speak, however, of
Ovid's elegance as his principa} distinction, it is only be'cause his sue-
cess in this respect is so trarrscendent. He waS, in imaginative power,
perhaps, superior to all other Latin poets; and Milton hesitates not
to affirm, that, but for the influence of misfortune on bis genius, he
would have surpassed Virgil in epic achievenrent. The Metamor-

. pheses, though in part indebted to Greek originals for form and mate·

rial, are yet a marvellons work of fancy. Some of the stories are
exuberant with creative force; and the subtle thread which connects
the diverse materials in one harmonicus and beautiful whole is not
less admirable than the structure itself . . . . Ovid was the only

writer of eminence who prolonged the golden age of Latin poetry be· ,

yond the time of Horace.” *

“His various compositions,'’ says another writer, from whom we
have already quoted, “comprehend many pieces of unsullied purity
and grace, which are still the first pages of antiquity we put into the
hands of our children, and among the last on which we turn the retro·
spect of our own declining years ..... His amatory poems were
principally the work of his earlier years, and the maturity of his powers
was devoted sedulously, nor with less felicity, to subiects of wider

scope and higher interest”i
