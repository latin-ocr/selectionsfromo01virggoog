nne Lissos ovio.

Iu the Tenth Elegy of the Fourth Book of his Tristia, our poet has
himself given us a minute account of his life and fortunes. In other
poems, he often speaks of himself, so that there are few writers of
ancient times with whose history we are better acquainted. Several
biographies of him have come down to us; but they add little of im-
portance to what we thus leam from his own writings.

Poenus Ovrnrus Naso was born of an ancient and noble family,
at Sulmo (now Sulmone), in the country of the Peligni, March 20,
- u. c. 43. At an early age, he was sent to Rome to be educated, and
studied with some of the most 'eminent teachers of the day, among
whom he mentions Arellius Fuscus and Porcius Latro. He was de-
signed hy his father for the bar, and seems to have made commend-
able proficiency in the preliminary studies of the profession: The
elder Seneca speaks highly of his declamatione, and has preserved an
extract from one of them. He remarks, however, that Ovid's oratory
resembled asolutum carmen, and Ovid himself tells us that whatever
he attempted to write took the form of verse sponte sua. His father
endeavored to wean him from this tendency to poetical pursuits, warn-
ing him that poetry was the direct road to poverty3 but, after a brief
struggle against the ruling passion, he yielded to his destiny, aban·
doned the profession for which he was intended, and devoted himself
to the service of the Muses. He mentions several of the leading
poets of the day as among the number of his friends at this time;
Macer, Propertius, Bassus, and Horace. Virgil and Tibullus both
of whom died when he was but twenty-four, he knew less intimately.
He seems to have been most familiar with Propertius, who, like him·
self, had relinquished forensic for poetical pursuits, and who occa-
sionally read to him his elegias, which naturally exeited the admira·
tion and the emulation of the youthful listener. Ovid, like Proper·
tius, had attempted epic poetry ; but the failure of his friend in this
species of writing„and his brilliant success in elegy, appear to have
determined his own hesitating muse. His first published work, the
Amores, was the result, and the favor with which it was received en·
comaged him to persevere in the career on which he had entered.
