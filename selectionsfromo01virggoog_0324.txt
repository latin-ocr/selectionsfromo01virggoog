Itis merely a conjecture, though it is probable, that Virgilius re-
tired to his paternal farm, and here he may have written some of the
small pisces which are attributed to him, the Culex, Ciris, Moretum,
and others. The defeat of Brutus and Cassius by M. Antonius and
Octavianus Caesar at Philippi, B. C. 42, gave the supreme power to
the two victorious generals, and when Octavianus returned to Italy,
he began to assign to his soldiers lands which had been promised
them lor their services. But the soldiers could onlybe provided with
land by turning out many os the occupiers, and the neighborhood ol
Cremona and Mantua was one of the districts in which the soldiers
were planted, and from which the formet possessore were dislodged

There is little evidence as to the circumstances under which Virgil Ι

was deprived ol his property. Itis said that it was seized by avet-
eran named Claudius or Clodius 3 and that Asinius Pollio, who was
then governor ol Gallia Transpadana, advised Virgil to apply to Oc·
tavianus at Rome for the restitution of his⁴ land, and that Octavianus
granted his request. It is supposed that Virgil wrote the Eclogue
which stands first in our editions, to commemorate his gratitude to
Octavianus Caesar. Whether the poet was subsequently disturbed
in his possession andagain restored and whether he was not firmly
secured in his patrimonial sarm till atter ὼε peace ol Brundusium, B.
C. 40, between Octavianus Caesar and hh Antonius, is amatter which
no extant authority is sufficient to determine.

Virgil became acquainted with Maecenas before Horace was, and
Horace (Sat. 1. 5, and 6. 55, etc) was introduced to Maecenas by Vir-
gil. This introduction was probably in the year B. C. 385 bnt, since
the name ol Maecenas is not mentioned in he Eclogucs ol Virgil, we
may perhaps conclude that it was not until aller they were written
that the poet was on those intimate terms with Maecenas which
ripened into friendship. Horace, in one ol bis Satires (Sat. I· 5). in

· which he describes the journey from Rome to Brundusium, men·
. tione Virgil as one ol the party, and in language which shows that

they were then in the closest intimacy. The time to which this
Journey relates is some'what uncertain, but the best authorities agree
in firdng itin the year B. C. 37. (See Hor. Sat. 1. 5. Iutrod) ,

The most finished work ol Virgii, his Georgica, an agricultural

poem, was undertaken at the suggestion os Maecenas and it was·

probably not commenced earlier than B. C. 37. ⁴· The tradition rbat
' Maecenas himself suggested the composition ol Georgicr maybe ac-
cepted, notin the literal sense which has gemahy been attached to
