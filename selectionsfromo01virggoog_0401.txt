this passage, which has perplexed the commentatore so much, is
probably 2 nec sect'tar (quum si densa seras) mnis secto limite vrb arbo-
ribus pon'tis in unguem quadret: yet still (as much as when you plant
close) let each avenue with drawn line, as you set your trees, exactly
tally ; i. e. yet still so set your trees that the line 01 each avenne that
you draw may exactlytally with the rest. Secto vrit limite then will a ,
orb secto. Cf. 1. 238, rab secta per ambos, where Virgil calls the ecliptic
vrb, while Ovid, M. II. 130, speaking more precisely, calls it limes.

quincuncial order is intended. Vm and limes are used in the sarno
