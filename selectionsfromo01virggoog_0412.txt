51⁶ sorus ott vinon„

The genuineness of these verses is doubtful. By Burmann, Peerl-
kamp, Heyne, and many other commentators they are condemned as
unworthy of the genius of Virgil, and inconsistent with the dignity of
epic poetry, andare assigned to some unknown grammariam but Wr.,
Forb, Heury„and others, regard them as genuine, 3ηά by no means
devoid of terseness and elegauce. Wr. does not, however, suppose
theru to have formed originally the beginning of the Aeneid, but to
have been prefixed, as an inscription, to a few copies of the first book,
which the poet circulated among private friends, as 3 sample of the
whole. They appear to have existed in the time of Servius 3ηά Do
natus, who say that Nisus the grammarian had heard a story of their
having been expunged by Tucca arrd Varius, to whom, aster Virgil’s
death, the revision of the Aeneid, preparatory to publication, was in·
trusted. See Life. ,

They may be translated thus: 1 (am) that (poet), who formerly
tuned 3 lay on a slender reedpipe (E. 1. a), and, having gone forth
from the woods (i e having abandoned pastoral poetry), taught ti. e,
in the Georgius) the neighboring fields to obey the husbandmen, how-
ever eager (for harvests),-a worlr acceptabis to cultivators of the
soil; but now (Ι sing) the horrid (arnis) of Mars. Horrentih ; so
arma and cano from the first line of the poem.

Arma = artus, war. The words arma vimmque are not abendi-
adys‚ as some have taught, but give first the character of the subject
and then the subject itself Troiam the chief city of Troas‚a dis·
trict in the northwest corner of Mysia, in Asia Minor. It was called
Trosa, from Tros, one of its early kings; also Ilium, Ilios, or Ilion,
from llus, the son of Tros; Dardanii, from Dardanus, the grand·
father of Tros; and raanan from Teucer, its first king; whence
also the Trojans are osten called Teucri. It was situated on a rising
ground, above the plain of the rivers Scamander and Simois. Ona
hill to the east of it rose its acropolis, called Pergamum or Pergama.
The city was protected by strong and lolty walls, said to have been
built by Apollo and Poseidon. Psimus The earlier commentators
have found a difficulty in reconciling primus with Antenor’s previous
migrationi (below, vv. 24² foll), and suggest that¹ Aeneas had first
reached Italy proper, though Antenor had previously reached Ve-
netia On the other hand, Heyne 3ηά Wr. make primm equivalent
to olim, thus weakeriing a word which from its position and its occur·
rence in the first line of the poem must be emphatic. The more ob·
vious sense is that Aeneas is so called without reference to Antenor,
as the founder of the great Trojan empire in Italy-a Italiam
