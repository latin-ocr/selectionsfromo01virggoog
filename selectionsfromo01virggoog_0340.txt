10⁵. Tres -ulnas According to Servius, Asconius Pedianus heard
Virgil say that he had intended in this passage to set a trap for the ’
critics ; and that the real answer was the tomb oi Coelius, a Mantuan
who had squandered his estate, and leit himself only land enough ior
a tornb. This traditional solution is now generally followed, though
various others have been proposed ς such as a well, an oven, the
shield oi Achilles, the pit called mundus in the Comitium, which was
opened but three days each year. Coeli, the poetical form oi the geni-
tive of Coelius, is the same as the genitive oi coelum, heaven; but in
the absence ol certain knowledge on the subject, we cannot do better
than translate itas the latter. Amplius ulnae Gr. 417. 35 37&

II. The flower meant is the hyacinth, which was inscribed with hihi
( alas! alasii to express the grief of Apollo at the death of Hya-
cinthus, whom he accidentally killed with a quoit, or, as others say,
to express the name of Ajax (star), oi which they are the first two
letters; or according to others, with the letter Υ for Ὑάκινθος (Hya-
cinthus). -108, Non'nostrum (sc est) = it is notin my power.

109. vitula Gr. 419. IV. A.&S. 244 Both ultimately wagered
a heller. See v. 49. Quisquis—amaros. This is obscure, but the
general sense no doubt is, as Serv. says, et tu et hic digni estis moulan
quicumque similis vestri est,· ie. any one who can feel love as you
’ have shown you can, the alarm which attends its enjoyment, and the
pange ol disappointment. --111κ Rivos=the sluices. This verse
admits of either a literal or a metaphorical interpretation. Accord-
ing το the former, Palaemon had gone into the helds in order to direct
his slaves to open the sluices ior irrigating his grounds, when he was
called upon by the two shepherds to act as umpire in their singing
match ς and now that the contest has ended, he turns his attention to
the slaves and tells them to close the sluices According to the latter,
the allusion is to the stream oi bucolic verse. The two interpreta-
tions may be combined, and the passage may be understood in both
sensea-
