ECLOGUE IX. - MOERIS.

Tira historical occasion of this Ecl'ogue has been already adverted
to in the Life of Wrgt'l. After obtaining a promise of protection, the
poet is said to have returned to his property, when his entrance was
resisted and his life menaced by an intruding soldier, whose name is
variously given as Arriae, Claudius, or Milienus T oro. He sought
safety in ffight, and made a second appeal to the higher authorities,
which was crowned with more permanent success Ruaeus conjec-
tures that this Eclogue was in fact a poetical petition presented to
Varus or Octavianus Certainly it is skilfully contrived to interest
the reader in the poet’s favor. Moeris, one of the servants, is going
to the town (Mantua), to carry part of the farm produce to the usurp·
ing proprietor, when he is stopped by a neighbor, Lycidas, relates his
and his master's troubles, and receives a warm expression of sym·
pathy at the loss which had so nearly fallen on the whole dismct by
the death of Menalcas (virgil), some of the poet's verses being quoted
to show how great that loss would have been, while it is hinted that
his successful return will produce further pocms.

1. Pedes ; sc ducunt. -2 vivi pervenimua=we have lived
to see, have reached the point alive; vivi expressing both that they
might have expected to die before such an outrage, and als0,that
death would have been a boon. Λάκου used contemptuously, as
in A. IV. 591. Nostri. .. ageffl=0s our (i e. of my) land ; slaves
then, as now, speaking of their master's property as their own. The
involved order of the words seems to indicate the perturbation of
, Moeris. — 3. Ut relates to an omitted co, implied in unipes-uenimus
