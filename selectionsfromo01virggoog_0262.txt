The life of Ovid, like that of most literary men, exhibits few prorn-
inent incidente. From himself we leam that he was thrice married.
His first marriage took place when he was very young, and was soon
. dissolved as a low and unworthy connection. His second wife was
also divorced, though he makes no charge against her. The third, to
whom he seems to have been tenderly attached, remained with him
until his banishment, in which she was forbidden by Augustus to ac-
company him. He studied at Athene, aa ¹was ctrstnmary with the
young men of his time. He held the judicia] offices of triumvir, of
centumvir, and of decemvir. Till his fiftietb year, he continued to
reside at Rome, where he had a house nea'r the* Capitol. He not
only enjoyed the friendship os a large circle of distinguished men,
but was honored with the favor of Augustus and the imperial family.

Meanwhile he had given to the world the second edition of the
Aturus,- the Heroidcsdn which the most tragic love-stories of an·
cient legend are versified under the form of epistles; a tragedy, Medea,
only two lines of which havecome down to us, but which was esteemed
by contemporary critice as his masterpiece; the Ars Amatoria, or De
Arte Amandi,· the Renudtiz Amoris ; and sonte minor poema. He
had been engaged for some ten years on his great work, the Meta-v
morphoses, which was nearly ready for publication He had collected
the materials for the Fasti, a poetical version of the pontifical ritual,
and may have made some progress in the composition of that worlc
While thus engaged, he was suddenly commanded by an imperial
edict to transport himself to Tomi, a town on the Euxine, near the
mouth of the Danube, on the very frontiers of the empire. A few
hours only were allowed him to prepare for the joumey which was to
remove him forever from his home, his friends, and his family. He.
was exiled, unheard and unarraigned, and the cause of his banish·
ment was only vaguely indicated bya complaint against the perni-
cious tendency of the Ars Amatoria, which had been published ten
‚years previous Had he been exiled at the time of its publication, it
might not have seemed extraordinary, since the poem tended directly
to subvert all those measures for the regulation of public morale
which Augustus was taking singular pains to enforce; but Ovid was
never molested on the ground of the licentiousness of his writings
until an event occurred, which is now hidden in impenetrable mys·
tery‚ although it is evident that it was no secret at the time: This

event was the real ground ot the banishment‚ for which the poem was
made the pretext. ¹ ’

It is much easier to showwhat the offence was not than what it
was. “ It seems to have been of a nature which Augustus could not
venture to declare openly: had it been an offence against public mo·
rality, he would have claimed merit for making¹ it the subject of a
