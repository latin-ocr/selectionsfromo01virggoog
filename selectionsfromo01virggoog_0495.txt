now so much desired by Dido, Junb devising a plan by which to bring
it about (90-128). The queen proposes a hunting excursion which
accordingly takes place; but while all are earnest in the pursuit of
the game, a violent thunderstorm is sent down by June, causing the

hunters to dy in different directions; Aeneas and Dido, however, ac· ’

cideutally take shelter in the same cave (129- 172). Soon after this
event Jupiter, roused by the remonstrances of Iarbas, sends Mercury
to Aeneas with an authoritative command to leave Africa ‚and make
for Italy (173-278), which order the son of Venus prepares to obey·
(279-295). Dido immediately suspects the intentione of Aeneas,

. and expostulates with him, but in vain (²9⁶·449l; and, accordingly,

· being unable to bear up against her grief, she determines to die (450-
473). Concealing her purpose from her sister, she erects a huge pyre
and pretends that it is intended for the oelebration of magio cere-
monies, by which she may be enabled to shake off her affection for
Aeneas and to forget him altogether (474- 521). Her grief now in-
creases to frenzy; but by this time Aeneas has weighed anchor, and
stands out to sea in the middle of the night (522 585). In the morn-
ing Dido, maddened by the sight of the Trojan ships in the distant
offing, breaks out in a paroraysm of lovesick sorrow, and imprecates
calamities onher once cherished guest (584-629); and having dis·

'missed all her attendants, she slays herself on the pyre (630- 705).
