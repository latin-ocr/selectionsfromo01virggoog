THE AENEID. Boox IV. '

Tira subject of the Fourth Book has made it the most attractive,
perhaps the most celebrated, part of the poem: it has provolred much
controversy, and that of a kind which has an interest, not only lor the
scholar, but sor the general reader3 much of it has been supposed to
be borrowed from Apollonius Rhodius, whose work happens to be
preserved: it is the most dramatic portion os the Aeneid, and as such
may be viewed in relation to the masterpieces os Greek dramatic art.

According to the most detailed accounts, as epitomized in the Dic·
tionary os Biography, Dido's early history up to the time os her land·
ing in Africa coincides substantially with that narrated by Venus to
Aeneas in Book 1. ; asterwards she is persecuted by her neighbor,
King Iarbas, who demands her hand, resolves to avoid him by death,
erects a funeral pile under the pretence of a sacrifice to propitiare her
former husband, and kills¹ herself there. Virgil turns the loveless
queen into a passionate lover, keeping, however, the gronndwork os
the character, devotion to the memory of her murdered lord, which
isonlyovercome by Venus’s express agency, and even then from
time to time struggles and resists Iarbas is naturally made to recede
into the distance; his anger contributes to darken the prospect of
Dido's desolation‚ but isin no sense the motive cause os her death.
The mode os her death is borrowed from the traditional story, and
the lact of her resorting to apretext to conceal her purpose ; butas
the reason forher death is different, the pretext is different also. Iu
filling up the picture which he has sketched Virgil is indebted partly
to Apollonius, partly perhaps to the Ajax of Sophocles.

Virgil’s power is nowhere more conspicuously shown than in the
lines describing the horrors which drive ‘Dido to her fatal purpose
