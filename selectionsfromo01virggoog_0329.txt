gustus. Propertius (II. 34) has celebrated the conclusion and pub·
lication of the Bucolics, and Ovid (Amor. I. 12) has soretold their
immortality. . ι

The title Bucolico was probably that given to these poems by
Virgil himself. It is from a Greek word which signifies pertaining
to the shepherd lese, pastoral. The title Ecloga is generally supposed
to have been added by the critica. It also is from the Greek, and
signifies‚ a selected piece ; so that Bucolieon Eclogue means, selectiores
from pastoral poema, Bucolicon being the genitive plural in the Greek
form. ’

ECLOGUE 1. — TITYRUS.

Tira subject of this Eclogue is Virgil‘s gratitude to Octavianus for
the favor shown him in the restoration of his lands, See life.

The speakers are two shepherds, one of whom is enjoying rustic
life, singing of his love, and seeing his cattle feed undisturbed‚ when
he is encountered by the other, who has been expelled from his horne-
stead‚ and is driving his goats before him, with no prospect but a
cheerless exile. This is simple enough, but it is complicated by an
unhappy artifice. The fortunate shepherd is represented as a farm
slave who has just worked out his freedom 3 and this emancipationis
used to symbolize the confirmation of the poet in his property. The
t'wo events, with their concomitauts‚ are treated as convertible with
each other, the story being told partly in the one form, partly in the
other.
