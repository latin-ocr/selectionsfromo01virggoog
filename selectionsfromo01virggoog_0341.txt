EC LOGUE 1v. - POLLIO.

In the multitude oi conjectures regarding the subject os this
Eclogue‚ Wagner’s vicws seem preferable. All Italy had been ex·
posed to dreadiul calamities ; first, from the division of thelauds,
spoken of in the first Eclogue; then. from the quarrels between An-
tony and Octavianus, and th‘e war which ensued‚ B. C. 413 and
finally, from a most severe famine, the result'of the blockade formed
by the fleets os Antony and Sex. Pompeius So much the greater

was the joy occasioned by the treaty of Brundisium, made in the
autumn oi B. C. 40, by which harmony was restored between the
two contending chicfs. Antony's agent in arranging the peace was
Virgil's patron, Asinius Pollio. A little asterwards, on his return to
Rome,'Pollio entered on the consulship, and about the same time
had a son born to him. There was a common belief at the time that
a new age was dawning on the world; and as Italy seemed to have
escapcd from its miseries chiefly through the means oi Pollio, Virgil,
in this Eclogue. congratulates him on his consulship, and does it in
such away, as at once to extol him as tha harbingcr of a new era os
happiness and at the same time to augur this, from the birth oi his
son, as an omen of future peace and prosperity. The coincidence
between Virgil's language and that of the Old Testament prophets in
relation to the coming of the Messiah is sufficiently strilring; but it
may be doubted whether Virgil uses any image to which a classical
parallel cannot be found This Eclogue was written in the autumn
