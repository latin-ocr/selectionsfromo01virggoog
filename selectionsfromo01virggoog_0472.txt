Greek drama; the hleeding myrtle, however, may be Virgil's own,
though Heyne gives the credit of it to the Cyclic poets: the adven-
ture with the Harpies was suggesoed by Apolloniae, who also gave
hints for the predictions of Helenus and the deliverance oi Ache·
menides: other legende seem to have given the outline oi the voy-
age, indieating the several places touched at. The mistakes made in
searching ior the new kingdom, the soene at Delos, the appearance
oi the Penates, the meeting with Andromache, seem all to he more
or less origum.

ARGUMENT.

Troy, according to the almost universal tradition, was taken in the
⁵ summer. The winter oi this year, which eounts as the first ol the
seven, is spent by Aeneas in making preparatious (1 —y). He sails
in the spring or summer oi the second year (8- 12), and spends the
winter in Thrace, where he huiids a city (13-18). The tragedy oi
Polydorus drives him away in the spring os the third year (ro-69).
He goes to Delos, and thence to Crete. Two years are supposed to ·
be consumed in his unfortunate attempt at colonization. His stay at
Actium brings him to the end of the fifth year (70- 284). The sixth
year is spent partly in Epirus, partly in Sicily. In the summer oi the
seventh he arrives at Carthage (l. 755). The remainder os the Book
(285 - 715) emhraces the incidente of the siath year, and of the seventh
up to the time oi the arrival . -

piies distinction or identification. All that mn be said is that they
